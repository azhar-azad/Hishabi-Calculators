# Calculators — Implementation Progress

Granular checklist tracked **phase by phase**, with each phase broken into **slices**. A slice is the smallest unit that is independently implementable, testable, reviewable, and committable. **One slice = one commit.** Mark each checkbox the moment it's done — don't batch.

Companion to [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) and [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md).

Legend: `[ ]` = todo, `[x]` = done, `[~]` = in progress, `[-]` = skipped/deferred (with note).

**Per-slice loop (binding — see CLAUDE.md):** implement → tests green → self code-review (medium; high for security/auth/money) → commit on `code` (Conventional Commits, reference slice ID in body) → push. PR `code` → `main` at natural checkpoints (typically end of phase).

---

## Phase 0 — Repo bootstrap

- [-] ~~Initialize git repo~~ — handled by user (creates remote, runs `git init`, creates `code` branch)
- [x] ~~Decide on package/product name~~ — Java package `dev.azhar.calculators`; product name **Hishabi** (PLAN.md §2)
- [x] ~~Add `.gitignore` covering Java, Node, IDE files (`.idea/`, `.vscode/`), env files (`.env*`), build outputs (`target/`, `node_modules/`, `.next/`)~~
- [x] ~~Create `backend/` and `frontend/` empty directories (with `.gitkeep` until scaffolded)~~
- [x] ~~First commit on `code` branch: `chore: bootstrap monorepo (Phase 0)` — includes .gitignore + empty dirs; push to `code`~~ — committed as `bdaae0d "project plan documented"` and pushed to `origin/code`

---

## Phase 1 — Backend scaffold (Spring Boot)

### 1.1 — Spring Boot project skeleton
- [x] ~~Generate via Spring Initializr under `backend/`: Java 21, Maven, base package `dev.azhar.calculators`; dependencies: Web, Validation, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver, Spring Security, Lombok~~ — Initializr returned **Spring Boot 4.0.6** (latest GA); starter names follow Boot 4 convention (`spring-boot-starter-webmvc`, split-out `*-test` starters)
- [x] ~~Verify boots cleanly~~ — full context load proven by passing `@SpringBootTest` below; Tomcat port-bind verification deferred to slice 1.3 (`/api/health`)
- [x] ~~Test: `CalculatorsApplicationTests` (Spring context loads); `./mvnw test` green~~ — H2 added as test-scope dep so JPA context can initialize without a configured DataSource (real DB config arrives in slice 1.2)
- [x] ~~Self code-review (medium)~~ — inline three-angle review, no findings of consequence (diff is ~25KB of unchanged Initializr boilerplate around a 5-line H2 dep addition)
- [x] ~~Commit `chore(backend): generate Spring Boot skeleton`; push to `code`~~ — committed as `d8bfbf0`, pushed to `origin/code`

### 1.2 — Spring profiles (dev + prod)
- [x] ~~`application.yml`: shared defaults + `application-dev.yml` (H2 or local Postgres, decide and record in PLAN.md §2) + `application-prod.yml` (env-driven `DB_URL` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD`)~~ — dev DB = H2 in-memory (PostgreSQL mode), recorded in PLAN.md §2. H2 dep promoted from `test` to `runtime` scope so dev runtime sees it. `spring.profiles.active: dev` set as default in `application.yml`
- [x] ~~Test: `@ActiveProfiles("dev")` boot smoke test; `@ActiveProfiles("prod")` boot test with env vars supplied~~ — `DevProfileBootTest` (asserts H2 datasource URL) + `ProdProfileBootTest` (boots with prod profile + property overrides to H2; full Postgres prod-shape coverage deferred to slice 1.8 Testcontainers)
- [x] ~~Self code-review (medium)~~ — three-angle inline review; one PLAUSIBLE finding (default-active dev profile is a deployment footgun if env var missing) deferred to slice 6.4 — see below
- [x] ~~Commit `chore(backend): add dev/prod profiles`; push~~ — committed as `07c5ebe`, pushed to `origin/code`

### 1.3 — Health endpoint
- [x] ~~Implement `GET /api/health` returning `{ "status": "ok" }`~~ — `HealthController` + `HealthResponse` record under `platform.health` package per PLAN.md §4
- [x] ~~Test: `HealthControllerTest` (200 OK + JSON shape)~~ — `@WebMvcTest` slice test with `@AutoConfigureMockMvc(addFilters = false)` to bypass Spring Security default auth (real "permit /api/health" config lands in slice 1.5)
- [x] ~~Self code-review (medium)~~ — three-angle inline review; no actionable findings
- [x] ~~Commit `feat(backend): add /api/health endpoint`; push~~ — committed as `f6429d7`, pushed to `origin/code`

### 1.4 — Global exception handler
- [x] ~~`@RestControllerAdvice` returning a consistent error shape: `{ timestamp, status, code, message, path }`~~ — `ApiError` record with optional `fieldErrors` (hidden via `@JsonInclude(NON_NULL)` when null) under `platform.error`
- [x] ~~Wire validation (`MethodArgumentNotValidException`), generic 500, and a `NotFoundException` placeholder~~ — three `@ExceptionHandler` methods. `handleGenerics` catches `RuntimeException` (narrowed from `Exception`) so Spring's framework exceptions (`NoResourceFoundException`, etc.) fall through to Spring's defaults and get correct 4xx codes
- [x] ~~Test: deliberate-throw path returns expected JSON; validation error returns 400 with field errors~~ — `GlobalExceptionHandlerTest` with inner `TestThrowController` (explicitly `@Import`-ed) covers NotFound→404, generic→500 (without leaking internals), validation→400 with field errors, plus a regression test that unmapped paths produce Spring's default 404
- [x] ~~Self code-review (medium)~~ — three-angle inline review surfaced the broad-catch issue (fixed inline)
- [x] ~~Commit `feat(backend): add global exception handler`; push~~ — committed as `4801792`, pushed to `origin/code`

### 1.5 — CORS config
- [x] ~~CORS config allowing frontend dev origin (`http://localhost:3000`), reading allowed origins from `app.cors.allowed-origins` property~~ — `CorsProperties` record (with `@DefaultValue` empty-list fallback) bound from `app.cors.allowed-origins`; `dev` profile sets `http://localhost:3000`; prod CORS deferred to slice 6.4 (env-var driven)
- [x] ~~Test: preflight `OPTIONS` returns proper `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers~~ — `CorsConfigTest` covers allowed origin (200 + headers) and disallowed origin (403). Also necessitated a minimal `SecurityConfig` (CSRF disabled, STATELESS sessions, `anyRequest().permitAll()` — slice 5.4 will tighten with JWT + real allowlist)
- [x] ~~Self code-review (medium)~~ — three-angle inline review; no actionable findings
- [x] ~~Commit `feat(backend): add CORS config`; push~~ — committed as `7c8824c`, pushed to `origin/code`

### 1.6 — Spotless (Google Java Format)
- [x] ~~Add Spotless Maven plugin, bind `check` to `verify`~~ — `com.diffplug.spotless:spotless-maven-plugin:2.46.1` with googleJavaFormat + removeUnusedImports + importOrder + trimTrailingWhitespace + endWithNewline
- [x] ~~Run `./mvnw spotless:apply` to format existing code~~ — 13 files reformatted to Google Java Format (2-space indent + Google import order); 1 file was already clean
- [x] ~~Verify `./mvnw spotless:check` clean~~ — `./mvnw verify` green: spotless:check passes + all 10 tests green
- [x] ~~Self code-review (medium)~~ — inline review; cosmetic-only diff to 13 files (no semantic changes); test suite all green confirms no behavior regression
- [x] ~~Commit `chore(backend): add Spotless (Google Java Format)`; push~~ — committed as `6534df3`, pushed to `origin/code`

### 1.7 — JaCoCo coverage reporting
- [x] ~~Add JaCoCo Maven plugin with `report` goal bound to `verify`~~ — `org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.13`, two executions: `prepare-agent` (default phase, injects the JVM agent into Surefire's `argLine`) + `report` (bound to `verify`)
- [x] ~~Verify `target/site/jacoco/index.html` is generated after `./mvnw verify`~~ — confirmed; report includes per-package HTML drilldown + `jacoco.csv` + `jacoco.xml` (for future CI/SonarCloud integration). No coverage thresholds enforced yet; can add as a follow-up slice when we have meaningful tax-calculation code to gate
- [x] ~~Self code-review (medium)~~ — inline review; one-plugin addition, no logic changes, all tests green
- [x] ~~Commit `chore(backend): add JaCoCo coverage reporting`; push~~ — committed as `908d25c`, pushed to `origin/code`

### 1.8 — Testcontainers (Postgres) infrastructure
- [x] ~~Add `org.testcontainers:postgresql` dependency (test scope)~~ — added `org.testcontainers:junit-jupiter` + `org.testcontainers:postgresql`, both `test` scope, both at `1.20.4` (explicit version — Spring Boot 4 BOM doesn't manage Testcontainers, unlike Boot 3)
- [x] ~~Add a smoke test (`PostgresContainerSmokeTest`) that boots a Postgres container and runs `SELECT 1`~~ — uses `postgres:16-alpine` image, static `@Container` field, JDBC `SELECT 1` via DriverManager
- [x] ~~Test: smoke test passes under `./mvnw verify`~~ — 11 tests total now green (10 previous + this one). Smoke test takes ~5-11s depending on container warm-start
- [x] ~~Self code-review (medium)~~ — three-angle inline review. One heads-up logged: CI workflow (slice 1.9) needs a Docker-enabled runner (default `ubuntu-latest` has Docker, so OK by default)
- [ ] Commit `test(backend): add Testcontainers Postgres support`; push

### 1.9 — CI: backend workflow
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with backend job: checkout, setup JDK 21 (Temurin), cache Maven, `./mvnw verify`, upload JaCoCo report artifact
- [ ] Triggers: PR to `main`, push to `code`
- [ ] Verify green on GitHub after push
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `ci: backend test + coverage workflow`; push

- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `chore(frontend): add Vitest + React Testing Library`; push

### 2.4 — Landing page placeholder
- [ ] Replace default `app/page.tsx` with simple landing: header "Hishabi", short tagline, list of future calculators (Income Tax, Zakat coming soon)
- [ ] Test: `Home.test.tsx` (renders "Hishabi" header and "Income Tax" link)
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend): landing page placeholder`; push

### 2.5 — Prettier + strict TypeScript
- [ ] Add Prettier with sensible defaults + `.prettierrc`

- [ ] Test: unit test mocking `fetch`
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend): add API client helper`; push

### 2.7 — End-to-end /api/health probe
- [ ] Dev-only page (e.g. `app/_dev/health/page.tsx`) calling backend `/api/health` and rendering result
- [ ] Manual verify: start both servers, page shows backend status
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `chore(frontend): wire /api/health probe page`; push

### 2.8 — UI component library decision *(decision — no commit)*
- [ ] Decide: shadcn/ui vs MUI vs hand-rolled (discuss with user)
- [ ] Record decision in PLAN.md §2

### 2.9 — UI library install + theme
- [ ] Install + bootstrap chosen library
- [ ] Replace one element on landing (e.g. button) with library component to prove it renders

---

## Phase 3 — Tax calculator: backend

_Rules derived from user's Excel — see PLAN.md §10. Pure-function service (no DB inside), data-driven rules._

### 3.1 — Tax package + domain enums
- [ ] Create package `dev.azhar.calculators.calculators.tax`
- [ ] Enums: `TaxpayerCategory` (GENERAL, WOMAN, SENIOR_65_PLUS, PHYSICALLY_MENTALLY_DISABLED, GAZETTED_FREEDOM_FIGHTER, THIRD_GENDER), `Location` (DHAKA_CHITTAGONG_CITY_CORP, OTHER_CITY_CORP, OTHER)
- [ ] Test: JSON serialization roundtrip via Jackson
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): add tax package + domain enums`; push

### 3.2 — Rule entities
- [ ] Entities per PLAN.md §6: `AssessmentYear`, `RuleSet`, `TaxSlab` (ordered, belongs to `RuleSet`), `CategoryThreshold`, `MinimumTaxFloor`
- [ ] JPA mappings + relationships
- [ ] Test: persist + fetch roundtrip via Testcontainers Postgres
- [ ] Self code-review (high — schema is foundational)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): add rule entities`; push

### 3.3 — Migration tool *(decision + wire-up)*
- [ ] Decide Flyway vs Liquibase (record in PLAN.md §2)
- [ ] Add dependency + config; V1 migration creates tax rule tables (no seed yet)
- [ ] Test: migration runs cleanly against Testcontainers
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(backend): wire <tool> migrations + V1 tax schema`; push

### 3.4 — Seed AY 2025-26 + AY 2024-25 rules
- [ ] V2 migration: insert one `RuleSet` row with the AY 2025-26 slabs (PLAN.md §10.4), category thresholds (§10.3), minimum-tax floors (§10.6), exemption cap (§10.2), rebate caps (§10.5)
- [ ] V2 migration: insert `AssessmentYear` rows for `2024-25` and `2025-26` pointing to the same `RuleSet` (per PLAN.md §10.0)
- [ ] Test: query AY 2025-26 → slab structure matches §10.4; AY 2024-25 → same `RuleSet` reference
- [ ] Self code-review (high — tax data correctness)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): seed AY 2024-25 + 2025-26 rule set`; push

### 3.5 — DTOs (request + response)
- [ ] `TaxCalculationRequest`: income components, category, location, disabled-child count, investments (by category), AIT — with Bean Validation (`@NotNull`, `@PositiveOrZero`)
- [ ] `TaxCalculationResponse`: full breakdown matching PLAN.md §10.8
- [ ] Test: validation rejects negative values and missing required fields
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): add request/response DTOs`; push

### 3.6 — Calculation service: salary exemption
- [ ] `TaxCalculationService` skeleton — pure function `(RuleSet, TaxCalculationRequest) → intermediate`, no DB inside
- [ ] Step 1: `taxFreeSalary = min(total/3, 450k)`
- [ ] Test: salary exemption below and above the 450k cap
- [ ] Self code-review (high — money math)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): calculation — salary exemption`; push

### 3.7 — Calculation service: effective first-slab threshold
- [ ] Step 2: `effectiveThreshold = categoryThreshold + 50,000 × disabledChildren`
- [ ] Test: one case per taxpayer category (6 tests); disabled-child add (0, 1, 3 children)
- [ ] Self code-review (high — money math)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): calculation — effective threshold`; push

### 3.8 — Calculation service: slab walk
- [ ] Step 3: walk slabs in order, taxing `min(remaining, slabWidth) × rate`; produce slab-by-slab breakdown
- [ ] Test: matches expected per-slab tax for typical incomes (low → all in slab 1, mid → spans 1–3, high → spans all 7)
- [ ] Self code-review (high — money math)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): calculation — slab walk`; push

### 3.9 — Calculation service: investment rebate
- [ ] Step 4: per-item investment caps (PLAN.md §10.5), then `rebate = min(0.03 × taxable, 0.15 × eligible, 1,000,000)`; rebate = 0 if `taxable ≤ 0`
- [ ] Test: rebate cap binding on each of the three legs (3%, 15%, 1M); zero-taxable case
- [ ] Self code-review (high — money math)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): calculation — investment rebate`; push

### 3.10 — Calculation service: minimum tax floor
- [ ] Step 5: `withFloor = (taxable > 0) ? max(afterRebate, floorByLocation) : 0`
- [ ] Test: below-floor case per location (Dhaka 5k, other-CC 4k, other 3k); zero taxable income → no floor applied
- [ ] Self code-review (high — money math)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): calculation — minimum tax floor`; push

### 3.11 — Calculation service: AIT credit
- [ ] Step 6: `netTax = max(0, withFloor − AIT)`; modeled separately from rebate
- [ ] Test: AIT > tax → net = 0 (no refund modeled); AIT < tax → net = tax − AIT
- [ ] Self code-review (high — money math)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): calculation — AIT credit`; push

### 3.12 — Worked-example regression test
- [ ] End-to-end test exactly reproducing PLAN.md §10.8 (expected net tax = 56,820)
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `test(tax): worked-example regression`; push

### 3.13 — POST /api/calculators/tax/calculate
- [ ] Controller: `POST /api/calculators/tax/calculate` — accepts `TaxCalculationRequest`, returns `TaxCalculationResponse`; resolves active `RuleSet` by AY (default to latest)
- [ ] Test: MockMvc happy path; validation error returns 400 with global-error JSON shape
- [ ] Self code-review (high — public API surface)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): POST /api/calculators/tax/calculate`; push

### 3.14 — GET /api/calculators/tax/rules/{assessmentYear}
- [ ] Controller: returns the rule set for an AY (slabs, category thresholds, floors, caps)
- [ ] Test: 200 with full payload for `2025-26`; 404 for unknown year
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(tax): GET /api/calculators/tax/rules/{year}`; push

---

## Phase 4 — Tax calculator: frontend

### 4.1 — Route + empty page skeleton
- [ ] `app/calculators/tax/page.tsx` with header "Bangladeshi Income Tax — AY 2025-26"
- [ ] Linked from landing page
- [ ] Test: page renders header; landing link navigates
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend-tax): tax page skeleton`; push

### 4.2 — Fetch + render rules
- [ ] On mount, call `GET /api/calculators/tax/rules/2025-26`; render slab table + category list (for confidence, not interactive yet)
- [ ] Loading + error states
- [ ] Test: mocked API → renders slab rows
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend-tax): render rules from backend`; push

### 4.3 — Input form (no submit yet)
- [ ] Form: income components, category dropdown, location dropdown, disabled-child count, investments (per type), AIT
- [ ] Use UI library form components
- [ ] Test: renders all fields; default values reasonable
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend-tax): input form structure`; push

### 4.4 — Client-side validation
- [ ] Validate: required fields, non-negative numbers; surface inline errors
- [ ] Test: invalid input shows error; valid input clears error
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend-tax): client-side validation`; push

### 4.5 — Submit + API call
- [ ] On submit → `POST /api/calculators/tax/calculate`; handle loading + server validation errors
- [ ] Test: mocked API → success path stores response; error path surfaces message
- [ ] Self code-review (high — user-visible API integration)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend-tax): submit + calculate API call`; push

### 4.6 — Render breakdown
- [ ] Display: taxable income, slab-by-slab tax rows, gross tax, rebate (with which leg bound), after-rebate, minimum-tax bump (if applied), AIT credit, **net tax**
- [ ] Test: snapshot/structure test for the worked-example response (PLAN.md §10.8)
- [ ] Self code-review (high — user-facing correctness)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend-tax): render calculation breakdown`; push

### 4.7 — Mobile-responsive polish
- [ ] Layout works on mobile widths (form stacks, tables scroll)
- [ ] Manual verify in browser at 375px / 768px / desktop
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `style(frontend-tax): responsive layout`; push

---

## Phase 5 — Auth + history persistence

### 5.1 — Users table + entity
- [ ] Migration: `users` (id, email unique, password_hash, created_at)
- [ ] JPA entity `User` + repository
- [ ] Test: persist + lookup by email via Testcontainers
- [ ] Self code-review (high — schema)
- [ ] Commit `feat(auth): users table + entity`; push

### 5.2 — Signup endpoint (BCrypt)
- [ ] `POST /api/auth/signup` — validates email + password strength, BCrypt hash, returns user id (not token yet)
- [ ] Test: happy path; duplicate-email rejected with 409
- [ ] Self code-review (high — auth)
- [ ] Commit `feat(auth): signup endpoint`; push

### 5.3 — Login endpoint + JWT issuance
- [ ] `POST /api/auth/login` — validates credentials, issues JWT (HS256, configurable secret + expiry)
- [ ] Test: happy path returns token; wrong password → 401
- [ ] Self code-review (high — auth)
- [ ] Commit `feat(auth): login + JWT issuance`; push

### 5.4 — Spring Security stateless filter chain
- [ ] Configure stateless security: JWT validation filter, public allow-list (health, calculate, rules, signup, login)
- [ ] Test: protected endpoint without token → 401; with valid token → 200; with expired token → 401
- [ ] Self code-review (high — auth)
- [ ] Commit `feat(auth): JWT filter + security config`; push

### 5.5 — Calculations history table
- [ ] Migration: `calculations` (id, user_id FK, assessment_year, request_json, response_json, created_at)
- [ ] JPA entity + repository
- [ ] Test: persist + fetch by user via Testcontainers
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(history): calculations table + entity`; push

### 5.6 — Persist calculation when logged-in
- [ ] In tax calculate controller: if authenticated, save calculation row
- [ ] Test: unauthenticated → not saved; authenticated → saved with correct user_id
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(history): save calculation for logged-in users`; push

### 5.7 — List calculation history
- [ ] `GET /api/calculators/tax/history` — paginated, current user only
- [ ] Test: returns own rows only; pagination respected
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(history): list endpoint`; push

### 5.8 — Frontend signup page
- [ ] `app/account/signup/page.tsx` with form, validation, error handling
- [ ] Test: form renders; mocked API success redirects to login
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend-auth): signup page`; push

### 5.9 — Frontend login + auth context
- [ ] `app/account/login/page.tsx`; React context for current user + token (httpOnly cookie preferred)
- [ ] API client attaches token to requests
- [ ] Test: login flow stores user; logout clears it
- [ ] Self code-review (high — auth client)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend-auth): login + auth context`; push

### 5.10 — "Save calculation" CTA when logged in
- [ ] Tax page shows save indicator / success toast when authenticated
- [ ] Test: logged-out → no save UI; logged-in → CTA visible
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend-tax): save indicator for logged-in users`; push

### 5.11 — History page
- [ ] `app/account/history/page.tsx` — list of past calculations, click to re-open with inputs prefilled
- [ ] Test: renders list from mocked API; click navigates to tax page with state
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `feat(frontend-auth): history page`; push

---

## Phase 6 — Deployment

### 6.1 — Choose hosting provider *(decision — no commit)*
- [ ] Compare Render / Railway / Fly.io free tiers at this moment; pick one
- [ ] Record decision in PLAN.md §2

### 6.2 — Backend Dockerfile
- [ ] Multi-stage Dockerfile (Maven build → slim JRE runtime), exposes 8080
- [ ] Verify `docker build` + `docker run` works locally; `/api/health` reachable
- [ ] Self code-review (medium)
- [ ] Commit `chore(deploy): backend Dockerfile`; push

### 6.3 — Provision managed Postgres
- [ ] Create Postgres instance on chosen provider
- [ ] Capture connection details into a secrets store (provider's env-var UI)
- [ ] (no commit — infra setup)

### 6.4 — Backend env config + deploy
- [ ] Set env vars: `DB_URL`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `APP_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, **`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`**
- [ ] Add a fail-fast `EnvironmentPostProcessor` (or `ApplicationContextInitializer`) that errors at startup if `spring.profiles.active` is missing or contains `dev` — closes the slice 1.2 footgun where a forgotten `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod` would silently fall back to dev profile + H2 in-memory DB in production
- [ ] Deploy backend image; verify `/api/health` and Flyway/Liquibase migrations ran
- [ ] (no commit — infra deploy; capture deploy notes in PLAN.md if useful)

### 6.5 — Frontend deploy
- [ ] Deploy Next.js (Vercel or same provider); set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to production backend
- [ ] Verify landing page loads
- [ ] (no commit — infra deploy)

### 6.6 — Production smoke test
- [ ] Hit `POST /api/calculators/tax/calculate` from prod frontend with PLAN.md §10.8 inputs; confirm net tax = 56,820
- [ ] Sign up + log in + save calculation + view history
- [ ] (no commit — verification)

### 6.7 — Uptime check
- [ ] Configure provider's built-in uptime check or a free external one (e.g., UptimeRobot) on `/api/health`
- [ ] (no commit — infra config)

---

## Future phases

- [ ] **Zakat calculator** — repeat Phases 3–4 under `calculators/zakat/` (will be sliced when started)
- [ ] **Mobile app** — pick stack (React Native vs Flutter vs native) based on user comfort at that point
- [ ] **Analytics / error tracking** — opt-in (see PLAN.md §11)
- [ ] **i18n** — Bengali + English (likely needed for BD audience; confirm with user)
- [ ] **Wealth surcharge** for net wealth > 4 crore BDT (see PLAN.md §11)

_When adding new slices mid-phase, append them in place (renumbering is fine — git history is the source of truth, not slice IDs). When a slice is no longer relevant, mark `[-]` with a one-line note rather than deleting — keeps the history of decisions intact._
